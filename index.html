            <h2>Bacon Q Dog</h2>
            <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

            <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
            <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>

            <img src="images/Pets/ash_looking_up.jpeg" width="400" alt="Black cat with light eyes looking up.">

            <p>Ash is a black cat that roams my apartment hallways. He's somehow always ready to greet me or my roommate and likes to run down the stairs to say Hi.</p>
            <p>If we're not fast enough, he will run into our apartment and hide somewhere. Ash won cutest pet for our apartments, and I'm inclined to agree.</p>
