        <p>My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her siblings.  They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it.  Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.</p>

        <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups pitted dates</li>
            <li>1 cup hot water</li>
            <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter softened (1 1/2 sticks)</li>

            <ol>
                <li>Grease or line an 8x8 baking pan. Preheat oven to 350F.</li>
                <li>In a food processor or blender, puree the dates and hot water until smooth. Measure out a cup of the paste (mine yielded exactly a cup,) and transfer to a large bowl with the butter.</li>
                <li>Cream the butter and date paste until smooth.</li>

                <li>Whisk together the butter, honey and cocoa powder. Add vanilla and whisk until smooth. If the glaze seems a little runny- add a dash more of cocoa powder. If it seems too thick- you can add a splash of milk. Drizzle over the brownies and sprinkle with more sea salt.</li>

        <p>I learnt how to cook Coca-Cola chicken wings from my mother, and I've since tweaked her recipe to better suit my family's palate, making it less sweet. While the cooking process remains straightforward, the result is incredibly flavorful, and once you've tried it, you'll understand its delicious appeal!</p>

                <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate the chicken wings for 1 hour</li>
                <li>Put the right amount of oil in the pot, and put the marinated chicken wings into the pot and fry it until golden brown on both sides</li>
                <li>After fry the chicken wings until golden brown on both sides, then pour a can of coke into the pan and bring to a boil</li>
                <li>Continue to cook for an additional 2-3 minutes until the glaze has thickened and coats the wings nicely</li>
                <li>Transfer the Coca-Cola glazed chicken wings to a serving platter</li>
